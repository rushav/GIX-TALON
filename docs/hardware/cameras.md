# Cameras

This file is authoritative for **inventory and specifications**: which cameras
exist, their serials and status, model specs, and network layout.

For working settings, SDK behaviour and what has been measured on this
hardware, see [../../mocap/docs/FINDINGS.md](../../mocap/docs/FINDINGS.md).
For the commands to build and run the capture tooling, see
[../../mocap/docs/RUNBOOK.md](../../mocap/docs/RUNBOOK.md).

OptiTrack Prime 13W — **legacy Prime series, not PrimeX**.
The Linux SDK docs only name X-series; legacy support is undocumented
but verified working on this hardware.

## Inventory

| Serial | Status                                          |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 33277  | In use                                          |
| 33659  | In use                                          |
| 33661  | In use                                          |
| 33663  | In use                                          |
| 33275  | Set aside — defocused, needs lens adjustment    |
| 33272  | Available, unlabeled                            |
| others | Available, unlabeled (9 total on hand)          |

Refocus 33275 with a variance-of-Laplacian metric rather than judging
sharpness by eye.

Working settings for ChArUco calibration capture (filter in, ring at full) are
recorded in [FINDINGS.md](../../mocap/docs/FINDINGS.md#2-the-ir-bandpass-filter-can-stay-in-for-charuco-capture),
not here.

## Network

Cameras self-assign link-local addresses and broadcast discovery on
UDP 13013. Host NIC `enp6s0` is link-local only and dedicated to the
camera network; internet comes over Wi-Fi.

    sudo tcpdump -i enp6s0 -n port 13013   # confirm a camera is alive

Discovery is staggered and can list a serial twice; see
[FINDINGS.md](../../mocap/docs/FINDINGS.md#8-device-discovery-is-staggered-and-can-duplicate).
